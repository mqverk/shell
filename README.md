## qs rewrite of my ags

I was too dumb back then so even I don't understand what I wrote there, its so hard to debug that. I'm still figuring out quickshell as I'm new to it as well. never worked with qml as well so learning it along the way.
dev exeperience is kinda horrible ngl. language server just doesn't detect anything. idek what to do. gotta remember stuff myself.

I had 4th gen cpu back those days so if this will be complete similar config then I'll be just very light. but I might add lots of cool stuff now tbh. not too quick tho. I'm busy man with college and life so gonna be very slow, if someone wanna help me. please do dm me over discord `dev_mannu`

also for some reason some apps like vscode & vesktop crash when I don't have quickshell launched, does anyone knows the reason?
